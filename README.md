# Spring Authentication and Authorization Project

This project is a Spring-based web application designed to demonstrate robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. The application integrates secure login, role-based access control, and resource protection, following industry best practices.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and session management using Spring Security.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure authorized users access only permitted resources.
- **Custom User Details Service**: Customized user authentication with flexible user data sources (e.g., database).
- **Password Encryption**: User passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt for enhanced security.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling and informative responses for unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used:
- **Spring Boot**: For rapid development and easy setup.
- **Spring Security**: For handling authentication and authorization.
- **MySQL**: Database management (or any other DB you used).
- **Maven**: For project management.
- **Thymeleaf**: For server-side rendering of the UI (or mention any front-end framework used).

## Getting Started:
